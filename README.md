# PERN Movie Database Project

A simple PERN Porject, it has some bugs and lots of things that can be improved on such as user validation or input validation and so on.

### Language Used

git clone https://github.com/wenloong/PERM-Project/
- cd client && npm start
- cd server && nodemon index

### Dependencies
- PSQL

### IMPORTANT
I did not include a bash script that will automatically create tables for you on your local environment, you will need experience in PSQL and install it on your own local machine. You can then use the commands that I have left in the create.sql script at the bottom to create your database.
